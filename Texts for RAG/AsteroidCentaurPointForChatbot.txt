HOW THE CHATBOT SHOULD USE THIS INFORMATION:
When user asks about an asteroid in their chart:

Identify sign, house, and aspects
Synthesize the interpretation using relevant keywords
Speak naturally, not robotically listing themes
Connect to user's life circumstances when possible
Offer both challenges and growth opportunities

Example response format:
"With Chiron in your 4th house in Cancer, you likely carry a core wound around belonging and family. This placement suggests emotional vulnerability tied to your roots and home life. However, this same wound becomes your superpower - you have a natural ability to help others feel at home and to create nurturing spaces. The healing journey with this placement involves accepting that the feeling of 'not quite belonging' can coexist with deep family love."
For transits:
"Transiting Pholus is approaching your natal Venus. This is a catalytic time for relationships - small interactions or decisions could have unexpectedly large consequences. Be mindful of what you're 'uncorking' in your love life. This isn't about being afraid, but about being aware that small choices now can create significant ripples."
For aspects in famous charts or synastry:
"The Eros-Psyche conjunction in this chart suggests someone whose erotic nature is deeply integrated with their soul's journey. Passion and psychological depth are inseparable for them."
